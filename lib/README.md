I don't know if this is where it'll live but for right now I have this folder here to store the "library" that I'm putting together.

TODO:
* Layouts are just structure. I like the idea of using a "debug" prop like in `react-grid-system` where it'll show up as grey. So I think I want to do the same but will not compile to prod.
  * I also wonder if it would make sense to also set the height of these items (for debug purposes) so that `region`s are rendered similary to if they contained `tile`s so when testing it out one can see what it looks like.
